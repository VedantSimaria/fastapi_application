Part 1: Beginner Level
Task: Setup Basic FastAPI Application with Beanie and User Model

Goal: Create a FastAPI application, integrate it with MongoDB using Beanie ORM, and develop a user model.
Requirements:
      Initialize a FastAPI application.
      Configure MongoDB and integrate with Beanie ORM.
      Develop a User model with fields such as username, email, and created_at.
      Implement endpoints to add a new user and retrieve all users from the database.


Unfortunately, I lack the necessary knowledge to finish Parts 2 and 3. I have worked with Fastapi and MySQL, and each component required the use of MongoDB, which prevented me from finishing the assignment as a whole.
